# Manipulating joint probability densities in python

The third part of the question asks you to:

The joint probability density function for the pair of continuous random variables (X,Y) is:

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x,y)=k(x^2y^2%2Bxy^3)\quad\textrm{for}\quad\1<x<2\quad\textrm{and}\quad\0<y<3)

(3) Calculate the marginals of this distribution.

You thus need to add SymPy commands in the code on the left to calculate the marginals of this distribution.  The variable `px` needs to be set equal to P(X=x) and the variable `py` needs to  be set equal to P(Y=y)
